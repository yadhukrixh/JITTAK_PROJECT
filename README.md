# JITTAK_PROJECT
=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [https://jittak-project.vercel.app/](https://jittak-project.vercel.app/) with your browser to see the result.

You can login with to the app with following credentials
**User Id / Email**: 'admin.s12345@allright.com',
**Password**: 'Password1234'

**User Id / Email**: 'user.s12345@allright.com',
**Password**: 'Password1234'

**User Id / Email**: 'superadmin.s12345@allright.com',
**Password**: 'Admin1234'


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More
This project is part of the evaluation process for the React.js Developer role, where the objective was to convert a Figma design into responsive, fully functional web pages. The following pages were implemented:

Login
Logout
Password Reset
Dashboard
User List
## Key Features and Technologies
- **React.js**: Utilized React.js to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces, ensuring smooth user experiences across different screens.
- **TypeScript**: The project is developed using TypeScript for type safety and maintainable code.
- **Responsive Design**: Focused on ensuring the application is fully responsive, adhering to the design principles provided in the Figma file.
- **State Management**: Implemented state management for each screen, following the flows provided in the Figma prototype.
- **Authentication**: Integrated a login and logout system using cookies to handle user sessions securely.
- **Server-Side Data Fetching**: Used Next.js server-side capabilities for API data fetching, ensuring improved performance and SEO compatibility.
- **Dummy Data Population**: The User List page is populated with dummy data to simulate real-world usage, with full functionality for pagination and filtering.
- **Vercel Hosting**: The application is deployed on Vercel, ensuring fast and reliable hosting with automatic scaling and optimal performance.

## Approach
The project follows modern best practices for React development, with an emphasis on clean, scalable code. I utilized Next.js for efficient server-side rendering and API data fetching, ensuring fast loading times and a seamless user experience. The login/logout functionality was implemented using cookies, ensuring secure authentication flow. The UI was meticulously converted from Figma designs, ensuring a high-quality visual match with the provided designs. The application has been deployed on Vercel for fast, scalable, and continuous integration, providing an accessible live version of the app.
